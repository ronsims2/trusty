This simple tool allows people (and scripts) to take notes from a terminal.

If you are like me, your desktop is cluttered with random text files that contain all sorts of program output. 
For me, using other note apps has always been painful for working with things like machine-readable text.
This app is designed to give you just enough organization to make your command line kung fu a bit easier.

cRusty is meant to be a catalog that allows you to use other CLI tools to create, edit, search and parse your notes.

Its pretty good for:

* Taking quick notes
* Bookmarking URLs
* Saving responses from curl/httpie
* Jotting down program output and error messages
* Building a glossary of hard to remember CLI incantations
* Cataloging small base64 data (files/images)
* Drafting haikus

## getting Started

When you first set up cRusty, it will create a `.crusty` directory in your home folder.
This is where configurations and your data are stored.

The CLI will also ask you to set a password.  This is used to encrypt notes.
This process will generate recovery code üõü that you can use set a new password if you forget yours.

‚ö†Ô∏è Save this recovery code in a safe place or else you protected notes will be lost forever!

## Usage

### Add a Note

Add a note with a title.

`crusty -t 'Foobar' -n "Who doesn't take notes in the terminal?ü§∑üèæ"`

Add a quick note with a derived title.

`crusty -q "The coolest kids use the terminal for everything."`

Pipe a note into crusty.

`echo "Sometimes you need to save the output of a program | crusty -i"`

```
echo "Sometimes you need to save the output of a program with a title | crusty -i -t "Saved Output $(date)"
```

Save a requests response.

`http -b https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all | crusty -i -t 'Dog Breed JSON'`


### View Notes

List a summary of all your notes.

`crusty` or `crusty -l`

Get a specific note using its ID:

`crusty -f 10`

### Search Notes

Use the full power of the command line to filter note titles.

`crusty | grep -i untitled`

Open the first note that matches a search.

`crusty | grep -i untitled | crusty -g`

Dump all your notes and search:

`crusty --dump | grep -i foobar`

Use more or less to page through menu results.

`crusty | less`

`crusty -e`

Edit the title and content of the last note touched.

### Encrypt Notes

You can create an encrypted note by adding the protected flag to any note creation command.

`crusty -o -p`

`crusty -t 'A new note' -n 'Some text for a note here.' -p`

When you try to open an encrypted note it will prompt for your password.

Decrypted and save a plain text note.
