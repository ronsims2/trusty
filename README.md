# cRusty
An open-sourced CLI notes app written in Rust.

This simple tool allows people (and scripts) to take notes from a terminal.

Its pretty good for:

* Making quick notes
* Saving JSON responses from curl/httpie
* Jotting down program output and error messages
* Building a glossary of hard to remember CLI incantations
* Cataloging small base64 data files/images
* Drafting haikus

`crusty -t 'Foobar' -n "Who doesn't take notes in the terminal?ü§∑üèæ"`
