This simple tool allows people (and scripts) to take notes from a terminal.

If you are like me, your desktop is cluttered with random text files that contain all sorts of program output. 
For me, using other note apps has always been painful for working with things like machine-readable text.
This app is designed to give you just enough organization to make your command line kung fu a bit easier.

cRusty is meant to be a catalog that allows you to use other CLI tools to create, edit, search and parse your notes.

Its pretty good for:

* Taking quick notes
* Bookmarking URLs
* Saving responses from curl/httpie
* Jotting down program output and error messages
* Building a glossary of hard to remember CLI incantations
* Cataloging small base64 data (files/images)
* Drafting haikus

## Usage

### Add a Note

Add a note with a title.

`crusty -t 'Foobar' -n "Who doesn't take notes in the terminal?ü§∑üèæ"`

Add a quick note with a derived title.

`crusty -q "The coolest kids use the terminal for everything."`

Pipe a note into crusty.

`echo "Sometimes you need to save the output of a program | crusty -i"`

```
echo "Sometimes you need to save the output of a program with a title | crusty -i -t "Saved Output $(date)"
```

Save a requests response.
